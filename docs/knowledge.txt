Erik Huckle is building a personal AI agent.
He wants it to serve as a Chief of Staff.
He uses LangGraph and Cursor IDE.
We built a decentralized, anonymous travel referral agent that lets anyone—without social verification or corporate approval—refer trips, earn automated crypto payments, and post referral records on IPFS.

Our agent uses:
x402 payments to enforce pay-per-use monetization and automatically split referral fees.
CDP Wallets to route payments directly to referrers with no intermediaries.
IPFS storage to maintain a decentralized, pseudonymous referral history—creating reputation without sacrificing privacy.
This creates a new travel ecosystem where contributors get rewarded directly and transparently, while preserving anonymity and bypassing centralized gatekeepers like Booking.com and Expedia
