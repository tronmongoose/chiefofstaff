# Project Vision & Roadmap

## Vision Statement

**"Create the world's first token-powered travel booking ecosystem that flips the traditional OTA model by returning 70% of affiliate commissions to users as TRVL tokens, while delivering voice-native AI experiences that make travel planning feel like having a personal travel advisor who's financially aligned with your success."**

We're building the "Costco of travel agents" - a platform that leverages bulk buying power and transparent economics to create the most user-aligned travel booking experience ever built, powered by Web3 tokenomics and next-generation AI interfaces.
