# Personal AI Agent

A LangGraph-powered AI agent that can handle weather queries, flight searches, travel recommendations, wallet management, and general conversation.

## 🛠️ Recent Troubleshooting & Dependency Updates

- **Coinbase CDP SDK Import Error:** Fixed `ImportError: cannot import name 'CdpClient' from 'cdp'` by uninstalling the incorrect `cdp` package and installing the correct `cdp-sdk` package (`cdp-sdk==1.15.0`).
- **NumPy/ChromaDB Compatibility:** Resolved `AttributeError: np.float_ was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release` by pinning NumPy to a compatible version. Later, installing `langchain_chroma` upgraded NumPy to 2.3.1, which is compatible with the latest ChromaDB.
- **ChromaDB Integration:** Added `langchain_chroma==0.2.4` to requirements for Python 3.13 compatibility.
- **Backend/Frontend Port Mismatch:** Fixed frontend connection errors by restarting the backend on port 8000 to match the frontend's expectations.
- **General:** Updated `requirements.txt` to reflect all dependency changes. Backend and wallet/payment features are now fully operational. Only minor warning: LangChain memory deprecation (not blocking).

## 🧠 How It Works

The agent uses a sophisticated multi-component architecture:

1. **Planner Node**: 
   - Analyzes user input using pattern matching and LLM
   - Generates appropriate tool calls for specific queries
   - Handles flight searches, weather, travel recommendations, etc.
   - Falls back to general conversation for non-tool queries

2. **Executor Node**:
   - Executes tool calls with proper error handling
   - Generates natural language responses from tool results
   - Manages tool execution and response formatting

3. **Memory System**:
   - Maintains conversation history across sessions
   - Integrates with LangChain's memory components

4. **Retrieval System**:
   - Vector store for document retrieval
   - RAG capabilities for knowledge base queries

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tronmongoose/chiefofstaff.git
   cd chiefofstaff
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your API keys:**
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```

## 🔧 Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Example Query |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `get_weather` | Real-time weather data | "What's the weather in Tokyo?" |
| `search_flights` | Flight search with pricing | "Search for flights from LAX to JFK on 2025-07-15" |
| `get_airport_info` | Airport details | "Tell me about LAX airport" |
| `get_travel_recommendations` | City attractions | "What are some activities in Paris?" |
| `get_todo_list` | Personal todo list | "Show me my todo list" |

## ⚠️ Notes
- The agent uses GPT-4 for optimal performance
- Weather data comes from OpenWeather API
- Flight and travel data comes from Amadeus API
- Todo list is currently hardcoded (can be expanded to use a database)
- Memory system maintains conversation context
- Vector store provides RAG capabilities

## 📝 Version Control
- **Do NOT commit your `.env` file**
- Add to `.gitignore`:
  ```
  .env
  __pycache__/
  chroma_db/
  ```

## 💰 Wallet Management

The agent includes cryptocurrency wallet management powered by the Coinbase CDP API:

- **Balance Checking**: View all cryptocurrency account balances
  - Supports multiple account types (VAULT, TRADING, etc.)
  - Shows currency and value for each account
  - Handles API errors gracefully

### Getting Coinbase CDP API Credentials

1. Visit [Coinbase Developer Portal](https://developers.coinbase.com/)
2. Create a new application
3. Generate API credentials with appropriate permissions
4. Add them to your `.env` file

### Wallet Tool Usage

The `check_wallet_balance` tool automatically routes queries containing:
- "wallet", "balance", "crypto", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "coinbase", "account"

Example queries that will trigger wallet balance checking:
- "Check my wallet balance"
- "What's my crypto balance?"
- "Show me my Coinbase account"
- "How much Bitcoin do I have?"

## Backend Setup

To run the backend server, always use the following command to ensure compatibility with CDP wallet operations and IPFS posting:

```bash
uvicorn backend:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --loop asyncio
```

This ensures the default asyncio event loop is used instead of uvloop, which is required for proper operation.

## Troubleshooting

**Chroma Database Errors:**
If you encounter `sqlite3.OperationalError` related to missing columns, delete your local Chroma database directory (usually `chroma_db/`) and restart the backend to rebuild the schema.

## Full Local Setup & Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. Backend (FastAPI/Uvicorn)
- Always start the backend with the default asyncio event loop:
  ```bash
  uvicorn backend:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --loop asyncio
  ```
- Or use the provided script:
  ```bash
  ./start_backend.sh
  ```
  This script will:
  1. Stop any running Uvicorn processes
  2. Wait 2 seconds
  3. Start the backend with the correct event loop

### 2. Frontend (Streamlit)
- In a separate terminal, run:
  ```bash
  streamlit run streamlit_app.py
  ```
- If port 8501 is busy, terminate any running Streamlit processes:
  ```bash
  pkill -f streamlit
  streamlit run streamlit_app.py
  ```
- The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) and is configured to talk to the backend at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### 3. Resetting the Chroma Database
- If you encounter `sqlite3.OperationalError` related to missing columns, delete your local Chroma database directory (usually `chroma_db/`) and restart the backend to rebuild the schema:
  ```bash
  rm -rf chroma_db
  ./start_backend.sh
  ```

### 4. General Notes
- Always use `--loop asyncio` for backend compatibility with CDP wallet and IPFS.
- No other changes are needed for the backend, Streamlit app, or IPFS logic.
