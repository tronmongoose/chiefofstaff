## 🧠 How It Works

The agent uses a sophisticated multi-component architecture:

1. **Planner Node**: 
   - Analyzes user input using pattern matching and LLM
   - Generates appropriate tool calls for specific queries
   - Handles flight searches, weather, travel recommendations, etc.
   - Falls back to general conversation for non-tool queries

2. **Executor Node**:
   - Executes tool calls with proper error handling
   - Generates natural language responses from tool results
   - Manages tool execution and response formatting

3. **Memory System**:
   - Maintains conversation history across sessions
   - Integrates with LangChain's memory components

4. **Retrieval System**:
   - Vector store for document retrieval
   - RAG capabilities for knowledge base queries

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tronmongoose/chiefofstaff.git
   cd chiefofstaff
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your API keys:**
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   AMADEUS_API_KEY=your-amadeus-api-key
   AMADEUS_API_SECRET=your-amadeus-api-secret
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-openweather-key
   ```
   
   See `env_template.txt` for the complete template.

4. **Test the tools (optional):**
   ```bash
   python3 test_tools.py
   ```

5. **Run the agent:**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

## 💬 Example Usage

```
You: What's the weather in San Francisco?
AI: The weather in San Francisco is 60.64°F with few clouds.

You: Search for flights from LAX to JFK on 2025-07-15
AI: Found 58 flights from LAX to JFK on 2025-07-15:
1. F9 - $107.85
2. B6 - $129.35
3. AS - $136.68
4. AS - $136.68
5. B6 - $137.95

You: Tell me about LAX airport
AI: Airport: LOS ANGELES INTL (LAX)
Location: LOS ANGELES, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

You: What are some activities in Paris?
AI: Travel recommendations for Paris:
Popular attractions in Paris: Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, 
Champs-Élysées, Arc de Triomphe, Seine River Cruise, Palace of Versailles

You: Show me my todo list
AI: Erik's todo list:
1) Build agent
2) Test LangGraph
3) Deploy system
```

## 🛫 Amadeus API Tools

- **Flight Search**: Search for flights with pricing and airline information
  - Supports IATA airport codes (LAX, JFK, LHR, etc.)
  - Returns pricing and airline details
  - Handles future dates for booking

- **Airport Info**: Get detailed information about airports worldwide
  - Provides airport names and locations

## 🔧 Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Example Query |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `get_weather` | Real-time weather data | "What's the weather in Tokyo?" |
| `search_flights` | Flight search with pricing | "Search for flights from LAX to JFK on 2025-07-15" |
| `get_airport_info` | Airport details | "Tell me about LAX airport" |
| `get_travel_recommendations` | City attractions | "What are some activities in Paris?" |
| `get_todo_list` | Personal todo list | "Show me my todo list" |

## ⚠️ Notes
- The agent uses GPT-4 for optimal performance
- Weather data comes from OpenWeather API
- Flight and travel data comes from Amadeus API
- Todo list is currently hardcoded (can be expanded to use a database)
- Memory system maintains conversation context
- Vector store provides RAG capabilities

## 📝 Version Control
- **Do NOT commit your `.env` file**
- Add to `.gitignore`:
  ```
  .env
  __pycache__/
  chroma_db/
  ```
